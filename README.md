# WWII-Cubes-Reinforcement-Learning-
Self-Learning Tactical Agents in a simplified WWII Arena using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning  
  
Documenting my work on a planned, two-month project where I delve into an interesting topic: Machine learning, technically reinforcement learning. I will also attempt to make the agents work with each other and create a multi-agent learning environment.  
Day 1-7:  
Started with research. Mainly [understanding ML in general](https://apxml.com/courses/introduction-to-machine-learning), then reading [setting up](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ml-agents@4.0/manual/Installation.html) and [learning about the MLAgents Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ml-agents@4.0/manual/Learning-Environments-Agents.html) from the documentation. I started with understanding the basic concepts like what RL is, what an agent accomplishes, what is an environment, reward types, episodes, etc.  I also dipped my toe into basic neural networks.
Then I tried playing with the [example environments](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ml-agents@4.0/manual/Learning-Environment-Examples.html) the package provides and reading the implementations for them.  

*currently in the making*   
made with Unity 6 using the [mlagents-toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)
